# Weather Updates Application

## About the Project

This project is made using React. User enters the city for which the weather data is to be fetched and the data is displayed. The displayed data includes the Location, Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed and Precipitation Chances. After the user enters the location Data is fetched from Weather API available on OpenWeather "https://openweathermap.org/api". If the data is not retrieved due to any reason, the website displays "Not Found" at all the values. The background changes with the temperature. If the temperature is very hot, the background changes to a desert, if the temperature drops below 10 degree Celcius, the background changes to a snow and if there is a more than 60% chance of precipitation, then the background changes to rainy. Similarly, the icons changes according to the weather.
